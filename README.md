# Wildlife Detector for Annotation

The purpose of this project is to use machine learning to speed up the annotation process for other image data. It will be accomplished by training a primitive machine learning model on a small amound of data with transfer learning and then exporting the final checkpoint as an inference graph to predict annotations.
